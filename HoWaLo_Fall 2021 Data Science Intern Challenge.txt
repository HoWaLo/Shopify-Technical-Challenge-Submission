Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set


On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 


1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
From the information in the dataset, I can assume that the AOV of $3145.13 is calculated by averaging the total items value, 
which is the amount of "order_amount" divided by the number of orders. However, this calculation does not account the number of items sold. 
To calculate the correct AOV, it should be the value of the total items divided by the total number of items sold, 
which is the amount of "order_amount" divided by the number of "total_items".


2. What metric would you report for this dataset?
        I would report the average value of items sold for this dataset.


3. What is its value?
        Its value would be $15725640 divided by 43936, which is $357.92.



Question 2: For this question you’ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.


1. How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM [Orders] 
WHERE ShipperID = 1;
Total 54 orders were shipped by Speedy Express.


2. What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?
SELECT e.LastName, COUNT(*) 
FROM [Orders] o JOIN [Employees] e 
ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID 
GROUP BY o.EmployeeID 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
        The last name of the employee with the most orders is Peacock; Peacock had 40 orders.


3. What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
SELECT p.ProductName , count( *)
FROM  [Customers] c JOIN  [Orders] o
ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN [OrderDetails] od
ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
JOIN [Products] p
ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE c.Country= "Germany"
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
        Gorgonzola Telino was ordered the most by customers in Germany; Gorgonzola ordered 5 times by customers in Germany.
